Summary: In May, 2015 I found an exploit on Gaana.com, which let me access their entire User Database (more than 10 Million) which included all the user info.

**Update**: I have removed the blog post. TLDR; On 12th of May I had discovered a vulnerability on Gaana.com. I contacted their team and it was fixed recently. I had written blog post in detail about it, now I think it's best I remove everything. Thanks for reading!
